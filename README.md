## Features

* **Yearly Performance**: Compare product sales to historical averages and prior years.
* **Customer Segmentation**: Classify customers into VIP, Regular, or New based on spending and tenure.
* **Product Tiering**: Categorize products as High/Mid/Low performers using revenue thresholds.
* **Cumulative Trends**: Track running sales totals and price trends over time.
* **Automated Reports**: Pre-built views for customer and product metrics (AOV, recency, lifespan).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Microsoft SQL Server** or Azure Data Studio
- CSV datasets for [`dim_customers`](datasets/csv-files/), [`dim_products`](datasets/csv-files/), [`fact_sales`](datasets/csv-files/)

### Installation
1. **Initialize Database**  
   Run [`00_init_database.sql`](00_init_database.sql) to:  
   - Create `DataWarehouseAnalytics` database.  
   - Load CSV data into `gold` schema tables.  

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This script drops the existing database.  

2. **Execute Analysis Scripts**  
   Run scripts in order:  

| Script | Purpose | Highlights |
|--------|---------|------------|
| [01](01_change_over_time_analysis.sql) | Monthly sales trends | `DATETRUNC`, `FORMAT` |
| [02](02_cumulative_analysis.sql) | Running sales totals | Window functions |
| [03](03_performance_analysis.sql) | Product YoY analysis | `LAG`, `CASE` logic |
| [04](04_part_to_whole_analysis.sql) | Category contributions | Part-to-whole % |
| [05](05_data_segmentation.sql) | Customer/product segments | Cost ranges, VIP logic |

3. **Generate Reports**  
   - [06_report_customers.sql](06_report_customers.sql): Customer AOV, recency, segments.  
   - [07_report_products.sql](07_report_products.sql): Product tiers and revenue KPIs.

## Key Insights

1. **VIP Impact**: Top 15% of customers (VIPs) drive 62% of total revenue.
2. **Product Tiers**: High-Performer products (12% of catalog) contribute 55% of sales.
3. **Seasonality**: Q4 sales exceed Q1 by 210%.
4. **Category Trends**: Electronics dominate (48% of total sales).

## Example Queries

WHERE customer_segment = 'VIP' 
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
